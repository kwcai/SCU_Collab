\chapter{Testing}
\section{Unit Testing}
We tested the application as it was being made to ensure that all sections were working as intended. The functions that we wanted to ensure were working include the login features, the ability to join groups and communicate with groups members, and to access a calendar of events. We set up a number of test accounts and went through the various features.

\section{Integration Testing}
Once we confirmed that all units of the application were working properly, we integrated them into one and tested the application as a whole. We went through a comprehensive test of every unique page within the application to make sure there were no errors.

\section{User Testing}
After the applicationâ€™s functionality was complete, we had other SCU students test the application. This acted as a stress test for our application by creating many test accounts and groups to see how well they could be handled.

Although students will likely create only a handful of groups with the application, we still created many instances of users and groups to test it.
