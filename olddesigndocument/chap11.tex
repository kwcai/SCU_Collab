\chapter{Conclusion}
Making SCU Collab a reality was a great undertaking that presented many challenges along the way. We learned a great deal about what working as a professional programmer would be like. From the satisfaction of creating our initial operating system, frustration at the accidental breaking of modules which took hours to fix, and our arrival at the final end product, we took away many valuable lessons from developing it. The greatest lesson we learned was by working as team on a simple concept, we could make systems that improve the lives of other people.
