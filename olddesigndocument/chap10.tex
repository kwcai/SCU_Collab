\chapter{Lessons Learned}
Over the course of creating this application, our team has learned many tools and skills that will help us in the future in an engineering career.

\section{Workload Balance}
Work was split between working on the front end and the back end of the application. Most of the more intensive work resided with working on the backend, yet we did not give it special attention until the later stages of development. This most likely increased the amount of time it took to implement certain features in the application such as creating groups.

\section{Proper Research of Technologies}
While we had some previous experience with the core web technologies used in this application, we should have properly researched the technologies that were unfamiliar to us so that we could plan our design better. Rather than diving straight into the code, we should have taken extra time to understand our options, specifically for using Phonegap. More research would likely have allowed us to be more efficient with our development.

\section{Communication}
Throughout development, it became clear that communication between each of us was important. It helped us know how much progress each person has made, or when one of us needed help on a specific module or task. This affected us in the early stages of development since we mostly worked individually on our on tasks.
