Currently at SCU, there is a lack of a coherent system that enables students to coordinate study sessions. In this project, we created a system that allows students to create groups, in which they can interact through an online forum and schedule meetings. We noticed that the current class system at SCU, Camino, in addition to keeping track of grades also features a discussion board that is heavily underused. We have come to the conclusion that students prefer using applications that specialize in a certain function, so the separation between grade trackers and collaboration systems would be more appealing. Using this system will work best for classes that focus on more difficult material, or for classes that place an emphasis on teamwork and collaboration.
