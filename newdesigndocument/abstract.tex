Currently at SCU, there is a lack of a coherent system that enables students within the same class to coordinate study sessions. In this project, we create a system that allows students not only to schedule meetings, but also give them the option to reserve a library room in advance if they desire. We noticed that the current class system at SCU, Camino, in addition to keeping track of grades also features a discussion board that is heavily underused. We have come to the conclusion that students prefer using applications that specialize in a certain function, so the separation between grade trackers and group study systems would be for the best. Using this system will probably work best for classes that focus on more difficult material, or for classes that place an emphasis on teamwork and collaboration.
