To make the user experience as simple and painless as possible, the application will function as a single Web page. The HTML main page will be stylized with CSS from the Bootstrap framework, and page functionality will be manipulated using Javascript. The user will be able to request information from the server in the form of HTTP requests. The server stores information about the groups that have been created and what students are in each group. Figure 9.3 shows the basis of the architecture as shown below.
