Figure 7.1 below shows how the technologies work with one another. On the client side, HTML and CSS provide the basic structure and styling. Javascript provides interactivity to the front end. JQuery Mobile also does some styling, but also provides an Ajax function. Ajax allows the application to make requests to the server side PHP files. PHP can then make requests to the database to send and retrieve information.
