\chapter{Design Rationale}
The reason we use technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript is because they are essential Web technologies that are well documented, and simple to use. JQuery Mobile, in addition to its interface across different devices, was also used in consideration of Phonegaps' nature. Phonegap does not allow for server side files, so we needed to use AJAX which allows for asynchronous requests from the client side to server side. Jquery mobile has an AJAX method  built in, which helped us retrieve requests from the server. We use the MySQL database management system, which allows us to relate entities to each other, such as users to groups. This is one of the main relationships on our application. PHP allowed us to connect to the database to send or retrieve information.

Many design decisions are made in order to enhance the usability of the application. The authentication system is based off SCUâ€™s authentication systems, so students do not have to create new accounts, and ensures that only students can use the application. It will also allow students more freedom and activity. The layout is kept simple since we have mobile devices in mind, and to limit visual distraction while maintaining user interaction. The sidebar is used to hide what is not being used. The forum is organized in a tabular format to keep the discussions organized.
