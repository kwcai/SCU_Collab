\chapter{Design Rationale}
The reason we hope to use these technologies is because they are standard technologies that we have experience with. These technologies are well documented, so there are many resources we can use to ensure our product is working properly. HTML and CSS will allow us to create a site that is easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing. Bootstrap will also help accomplish this, as it  lays out our application in a manner that is accessible on mobile devices. MySql is a database management system that we are familiar with and will be used to store user information.

Many design decisions will be made in order to enhance the usability of the application.
